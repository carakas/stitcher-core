# Stitcher

High performance, static websites for PHP developers.

```sh
composer require brendt/stitcher @alpha
php vendor/brendt/stitcher/install/stitcher site:install
```

Or as a project:

```sh
composer create-project brendt/stitcher-site
```

Stitcher is a **PHP tool** for **developers** to create **high performant websites**. At its core, Stitcher is a **static site generator** capable to work with popular **template engines**, and many data formats like **MarkDown, YAML, JSON** and more. 

Besides generating static sites, Stitcher has built-in support for **minification**, **image optimisation**, and **CSS precompiling**.

It supports more advanced features than normal web pages, like **overview** and **detail** pages and **pagination**. In the near future, Stitcher will also be able to handle **filtering** and **form submissions**.
