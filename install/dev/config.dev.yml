# The development config uses a few different paths to load files.
# There is also only one image dimension specified by default.

# This dev environment should be accessed via a separate virtual host.
# An Apache example of such host configuration could be:
#
# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     DocumentRoot "<path_to_project>/dev"
#     ServerName dev.stitcher.local
#     ErrorLog "<log_path>/error.log"
#     CustomLog "<log_path>/access.log" common
#
#     <Directory "<path_to_project>/dev">
#         AllowOverride All
#         Require all granted
#     </Directory>
# </VirtualHost>
